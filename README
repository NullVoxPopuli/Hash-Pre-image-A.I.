To-Do:
• Implement Parallel processing  
-- All Swarm agents will write to shared memory
-- That shared memory will be polled every so often for epoch updates, and outputted to the console
• Re-organize main so that all the arguments can be in any order, and the execution of the program won't change  
• 

Long Term:
• Create hash-free version, and release to the public is a tool to easily use fann with?
